# React + Vite
## This app is about search gifs using Gihpy API and fetch with React and CSS

**You can reviwe my app following the url: https://search-gif-pro.netlify.app/ !**
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.


Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
